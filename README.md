This is an effort to port the openscad code to a python script creating the stl
directly. This creates a much simpler stl.

to do:

* write nice description
* organize directory

* look up copyright / usage 

* make whole bevel gear (including translations, rotations)

* make whole herringbone bevel gear

* make herringbone bevel gear pair with assembly instructions

nice to have:

* polygons centered around center of gear (bore??)

* clean up code

* go over numerical stability

* user interface

* detail slider (increase 16)
